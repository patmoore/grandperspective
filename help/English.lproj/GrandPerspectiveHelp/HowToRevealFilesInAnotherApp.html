<h1>How to reveal files in another application</h1>
</div>

<p>
By default, when you reveal a file it will be shown in Finder.
If you want to, you can use another application to reveal files.
You can do so by setting the <tt>customFileRevealApplication</tt> key in the GrandPerspective user defaults to the name of the application that you want to use instead.
This can be done in the Terminal by entering the following:
<tt>defaults write net.sourceforge.grandperspectiv customFileRevealApplication -string ApplicationName</tt>.
Please make sure that GrandPerspective is not running when you do this, otherwise there is a chance that the change will be undone by the application.
